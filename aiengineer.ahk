; --- Notes ---
; - This is a simple hotstring replacement using AutoHotkey v1 hotstrings.
; - If you want case-insensitive matching, change the hotstring to:
;   :i:/aiengineer::
; - If you want to include an ending space automatically, you can append a space
;   in the SendRaw line like: SendRaw, hello ... engineer. 
;   But AutoHotkey will normally send the typed ending character for you.
