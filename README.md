## AutoHotkey text-expansion for `/aiengineer`

This workspace adds a small AutoHotkey script that expands the typed trigger `/aiengineer` into a short greeting message.

Files included

- `aiengineer.ahk` ‚Äî AutoHotkey v1 script. Type `/aiengineer` (then Space or Enter) to insert the greeting.

How it works (contract)

- Input: typing the characters `/aiengineer` in any editable text field.
- Output: replaced text `hello this is rifat erdem sahin. I am an ai engineer.`
- Error modes: If AutoHotkey is not running, nothing will happen. If the script is not saved or is blocked by antivirus, it must be allowed.
- Success criteria: typing `/aiengineer` followed by a space (or Enter) inserts the greeting.

Quick setup (Windows)

1. Install AutoHotkey (v1.x)
	- Download and install from the official site: https://www.autohotkey.com/

2. Place the script
	- Save `aiengineer.ahk` somewhere convenient (for example, your Documents folder or `C:\Users\<you>\Documents\AutoHotkey\`).

3. Run the script
	- Double-click `aiengineer.ahk` to run it. A green AutoHotkey icon should appear in the system tray.

4. Test
	- Open Notepad, Word, or a browser text field. Type `/aiengineer` then press Space (or Enter). It should expand to:

	 hello this is rifat erdem sahin. I am an ai engineer.

Run at startup (optional)

To have the script start when you sign in:

1. Press Win+R and paste `shell:startup` then press Enter.
2. Create a shortcut to `aiengineer.ahk` inside the opened Startup folder.
	- Right-click the script -> Create shortcut -> Move the shortcut to the Startup folder.

Advanced notes and customization

- Case-insensitive trigger: if you'd like `/AIEngineer` or variants to work, open `aiengineer.ahk` and change the hotstring line to:

  :i:/aiengineer::

- Add an automatic trailing space or punctuation by changing the SendRaw line. Example (adds a trailing space):

  SendRaw, hello this is rifat erdem sahin. I am an ai engineer. 

- If you want a trigger that expands immediately without requiring a terminating character, AutoHotkey can do that with more advanced Input handling. This simple hotstring uses the default behavior (works after a terminator).

Cross-platform alternatives

- Linux: espanso (https://espanso.org/) provides similar text expansion capabilities.
- macOS: use native text replacements in System Preferences or tools like TextExpander.

Security and antivirus

Some antivirus products may flag AutoHotkey scripts or compiled executables. If you compile the script to an EXE, you may need to whitelist it.

Next steps (suggested)

- If you want immediate expansion without requiring a space, I can add an advanced AHK version that uses the Input command.
- If you'd like the script compiled to an EXE for distribution, I can add instructions for compiling with the AutoHotkey compiler.
